                <p>Nearly 31% of our planet’s land area is covered with forests. However, the continuous decline in forest land has led to increased carbon emissions, diminished biodiversity and the disappearance of livelihoods in rural communities. Given the prominence of forests, the former Union Minister for Agriculture and Food, KM Munshi, launched Van Mahotsav Day, the Forest Festival, in 1950. Since then, the seven-day-long festival has been celebrated annually. Observed from July 1 to 7, the significant day is marked by planting thousands of trees.</p>

    <p>A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, an institution offering vocational education, a further education institution, or a secondary school.

In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher-education provider that does not have university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. In the United States, a college may offer undergraduate programs – either as an independent institution or as the undergraduate program of a university – or it may be a residential college of a university or a community college, referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions that aim to provide affordable and accessible education, usually limited to two-year associate degrees.[1] The word is generally also used as a synonym for a university in the US.[2] Colleges in countries such as France, Belgium, and Switzerland provide secondary education.
